No one knows what it's like
To be the nice man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes   git config --global user.email "villaisaac722@gmail.com"

And no one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated to telling only lies
But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free
No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
